## Overview

**RandomForest** is a repository implementing regression and classification models based on the Random Forest algorithm, specifically applied to **PM2.5 air quality prediction in Iran**. The project provides a practical example of using machine learning techniques to address environmental challenges.

## Features

- **Regression & Classification**: Supports both regression and classification use-cases with Random Forests.
- **Air Quality Focus**: Models are tailored for predicting and analyzing PM2.5 air quality data in Iran.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Built in Jupyter Notebook for easy exploration, visualization, and reproducibility.
- **MIT Licensed**: Open source and free to use under the MIT license.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rustam64/RandomForest.git
    cd RandomForest
    ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
    - Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```
    - Open the main notebook file (e.g., `RandomForest_PM25.ipynb` or similar).

3. **Install dependencies**
    - Make sure you have the required Python packages (such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`). You can install them with:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
      or manually:
      ```bash
      pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
      ```

4. **Run the notebook**
    - Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate Random Forest models on air quality data.
